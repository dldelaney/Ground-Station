checksum around each individual command (no more than 1 command in a message)
checksum example ->  ~msg[num]
where num is the sum of all the ACII values of the chars in the message

first char of message:
C - command
	R - return home
	L - autoland (line up with runway)
	M - manual override (see next char) (should be activated whenever joystick moves past certain amount past center)
		R - roll
		P - pitch
		T - throttle
	A - autopilot (see next char)
		S - speed
		P - pitch
		A - altitude
		B - bank
		H - heading
			(All: see next char)
			1 - enable
			0 - disable
	P - PID setting (see next char)
		A - altitude
		P - pitch
		B - bank
		S - speed
		H - heading
		R - runway lineup
			(All: see next char)
			p - P setting
			i - I setting
			d - D setting
			1 - enable
			0 - disable
	Z - zero values (see next char) (set offsets)
		B - barometer
		-either no number here, or a 1 to set the offset and a 0 to remove it
		
D - data (see second char)
	S - speed
	G - gyro (see third char)
		x, y, z
	L - location (lat/lng) (see third char)
		a - lat
		n - lng
	A - altitude
	H - heading
	V - vertical speed
	---the rest of the command will be a single number---

if "critical" msg (autopilot, returnHome, etc.) don't send next msg until recieved ack msg
-ack msg is correct checksum of previous msg
